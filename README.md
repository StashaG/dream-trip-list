# Dream Trip List 

This app was created to review the fundamentals of React. The one thing I miss right now is being able to travel, so I decided to create an app that would allow my family and friends to create a list of their dream trip destinations. Places they would like to go after the pandemic. Who's ready for the pandemic to be over I am :raised_hand:. 

## Goal:
To review function and class components, state, props, and submitting form data. My plan is to continue to add additional features to this app.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
